    <h1>Flags of the World</h1>
    <img src="UK.png" alt="Union Jack">
    <p>Flags are a staple of a nation's identity. They consumate the ideals and ambitions of a nation within one image. More likely than not, you'll be aware of your own countries flag, along with some other iconic ones throughout the world. There are <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/geography/how-many-countries-are-there-in-the-world/">195 recognised countries as of now.</a> Since there are so many, other than their cultural significance, flags are essential to a country in another way- they are a universal identifier. While we all practice different languages, we all see the same colours. Unless you're colour blind. Or deaf. Whatever the case, a flag is much more easily recognisable than some words. If someone asks if you're from the 'Verenidge Koninkryk', you will most likely be confused. If they point to a Union Jack, however, you have a much better chance of answering correctly. As a way to remunerate my time looking at various flags, here's some more useless information about them: </p>
    <h2>Red, White and Blue</h2>
    <p> Many flags, as you probably know, retain a strict red, white and blue colour scheme. From following trends of the most influential empires, to just the practicality of blue and red dye, there are multiple reasons as to why so many countries adopt this. But how many countries adopt this strict scheme? 29.</p>
